The buttons use our accent colour to draw attention, and bring unity to the design.

-The regular buttons are used most often. They are present on the adoption cards, and for hierarchy buttons like the "Donate" or "Sponsor" buttons.
-The light buttons will be used sparingly, mainly in case there is a dark background on the site.
-The ghost buttons will be used in the form, to keep with the flow and not stand out as much.
